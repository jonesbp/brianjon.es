I am a historian and web developer in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

I am the Technical Lead for [_The Public Domain Review_](https://publicdomainreview.org) and was a co-founder and publisher of the digital history journal, [_The Appendix_](https://theappendix.net).

I run and cook. I am playing with a few projects around lists, citations, and indexes. I am also working on the online public history project, [Local Memory: A History of Music in Austin](https://local-memory.org).

I have been working on re-building my online notes at [La Tinaja](http://tinaja.computer) and coming back to [microblogging](http://micro.brianjon.es). I collect a list of [small projects](https://oddments.brianjon.es).
