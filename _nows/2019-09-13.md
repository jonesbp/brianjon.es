I am a [historian](http://tinaja.computer/2014/10/28/abstract-making-the-ocean.html) and [web developer](http://foamgarden.com) in Columbus, Ohio.

I am playing with a few projects around lists, citations, and indexes. I am also working on the online public history project, [Local Memory: A History of Music in Austin](https://local-memory.org).

I write and take notes at [La Tinaja](http://tinaja.computer) and have been getting into [decentralized](https://sunbeam.city/@jonesbp) [microblogging](http://micro.brianjon.es). Iâ€™ve started collecting a list of [small projects](https://oddments.brianjon.es).

I am a co-founder of [Advanced Clionautics LLC](http://clionautics.co) and was a co-founder and publisher of the digital history journal, [_The Appendix_](http://theappendix.net).
