I am a [historian](http://tinaja.computer/2014/10/28/abstract-making-the-ocean.html) and [web developer](http://foamgarden.com) in Columbus, OH.

I am playing with a few projects around lists, citations, and indexes.

I write and take notes at [La Tinaja](http://tinaja.computer) and have been getting into [decentralized microblogging](http://micro.brianjon.es).

I am a co-founder of [Advanced Clionautics LLC](http://clionautics.co) and was a co-founder and publisher of the digital history journal, [_The Appendix_](http://theappendix.net).
