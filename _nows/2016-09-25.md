I am a [historian](http://tinaja.computer/2014/10/28/abstract-making-the-ocean.html) and [web developer](http://foamgarden.com) living in Columbus, OH.

I am a co-founder of [Advanced Clionautics LLC](http://clionautics.co), having recently launched our first project [Backlist](http://backlist.cc).

I write and take notes at [La Tinaja](http://tinaja.computer).

I was co-founder and publisher of the digital history journal, [_The Appendix_](http://theappendix.net).
